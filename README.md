# Just several issues to be pointed out:

1. Your template (radioinputs section) containes IT-positions, whilst backend settings presume other positions - Lawyer, Content manager, Security, and Designer. That is why I have adapted the list to the backend settings.
2. This is my "second try" since I was mistaken with a project name using capslock :( previous version, if there is a need for chasing the progress, can be found here https://github.com/the-most-trained-trainee/TESTTASK2022
3. This is my second try of typescript usage. I have seen that it was not required in the task requirements, but I use it just for additional practice.
